## The Massively Multilingual Image Dataset (MMID)

MMID is a large-scale, massively multilingual dataset of images paired with the words they represent collected at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://upenn.edu).
The dataset is doubly parallel: for each language, words are stored parallel to images that represent the word, _and_ parallel to the word's translation into English (and corresponding images.)

By far the largest dataset of its kind, it has 100 languages (including English) and up to 10,000 words per language! (and many more for English.)

## Getting Started

See the [documentation page](doc.html)

If you have questions, please email the MMID users list, mmid-users@googlegroups.com.

## Downloads

We're happy to announce that MMID is available via the Amazon Public Datasets program!
Through their generosity, we're able to provide all of MMID free of charge via a public S3 bucket.

We currently have 75 out of 100 languages' data hosted.
We're working on getting the final languages (as well as the English translations) ready for distribution.

Check out the [downloads](downloads.html) page for options on how to access the dataset.
