## Images for Translation Dataset

Images for Translation (name pending) is a large-scale, massively multilingual dataset of images paired with the words they represent.
The dataset is doubly parallel: for each language, its words are stored parallel to images that represent the word, _and_ parallel to the word's translation into English (and corresponding images.)

By far the largest dataset of its kind, with 100 languages and up to 10,000 words per language, it is useful for evaluating image-based translation methods.
