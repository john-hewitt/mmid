Due to the size and scale of Imgt, we provide a few different views of the dataset.

 - <span style="color:#B08519">[raw]</span> On the large end, we have raw image and web crawls for up to 10,000 words in each of 100 languages.
This is about **26TB**. 
 - <span style="color:#B08519">[med]</span> For 30 languages, we extracted CNN features and plaintext for all words of a language. Using these, you can recreate or improve on the translation results of our ACL paper. This is about **TBD TB**.
 - <span style="color:#B08519">[small]</span> For the same 30 languages, we provide a "toy" sample for development, with 1 image representing each word. The format of this view is the same as \[med\]. This is about **TBD TB**.
