## Code

To replicate the experiments in _Learning Translations via Images_, you'll need the code at this [github repo](https://github.com/john-hewitt/mmid-tools).
It contains  scripts for reading in CNN image feature files and predicting translations as described in the paper.


## **<span style="color:#B08519">CNN package</span>** Downloads

For these 30 languages, we extracted CNN features and plaintext for all words of a language. Using these, you can recreate or improve on the translation results of our ACL paper. As a warning, each download is as much as **11 GB** per language!
The metadata files relate images to their URLs.

## MMID packages
We're making progress towards getting all MMID language packages up and available!
Right now, we're working on packaging the data such that it's quick and easy to get started with MMID.
These packages, as described on the documentation page, are on the way.
