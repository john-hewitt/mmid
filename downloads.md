It contains  scripts for reading in CNN image feature files and predicting translations as described in the paper.

For these 30 languages, we extracted CNN features and plaintext for all words of a language. Using these, you can recreate or improve on the translation results of our ACL paper. This is about **TBD GB** per language.
The metadata files relate images to their URLs.
